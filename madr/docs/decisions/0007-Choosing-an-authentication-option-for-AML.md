# Choosing an authentication option for AML
## Context and Problems Statement
For AML project, we require to have a strong security basis to protect the user's sensitive information and have them have trust in us to protect their information and not let in fall into the wrong hands. Also we need to make GDPR standards for us to be able to run this project as an actual business as well.

### Considered Option
User and Password
OAuth2 / Social Login
Hash passwords

#### Decision Outcome

Chosen Option:"User and Password", offers a strong, secure and easy way for users to access their account within the application. Also there is a familiarity aspect to this method as many application run this system as well. Also, not needing a third party system to rely on is great as if the third party system crashes it won't affect us. As well as the usability as of this system across all platforms makes this easy and user friendly for the user as well. As well as it meets the GDPR standards as well.
