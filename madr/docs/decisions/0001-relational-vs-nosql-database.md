# Using a rational vs NoSQL database

## Context and Problem Statement

Deciding on a type of database in which we are going to use to store all of the data associated with the library including all the media, member information and other data.

## Considered Options

* Relational database
* NoSQL database

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Relational database", because it is very important for the data on media and users to be organised and easy to query.
