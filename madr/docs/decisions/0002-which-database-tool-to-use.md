# Which database tool to use

## Context and Problem Statement

Deciding which database tool to use, each option has it's own benefits and we need to weigh them all up and decide which to use in our solution.

## Considered Options

* MySQL
* Microsoft SQL Server
* Oracle database

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MySQL", due to it's great performance allowing for fast read/write operations to run on the backend of the website, it also has great community support due to being open source, meaning great levels of support for any problem we may face.
