# Choosing another supportive language to build website

## Context and Problems Statement
    
The project expect a huge users everydays, show comfortable and nice UI is required to meet the expectation. Also, it need very smoothly servcie and function to please users. The lack of knowing more framework for front-end is a huge limitations and reducing our option. 
### Considered Option 

-React (UI)
-Angular (UI)
-Vue.js (UI)
-JavaScipt (Funtion)
#### Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: "JavaScript". JavaScript was selected due to its strength in building a website, ease of deployment on a variety of hosting environments. Besides, JavaScript also is familiar with our team members. But we can not decide which language we going to use for UI in this project. Need more time to understand each other strong and then decide later.
